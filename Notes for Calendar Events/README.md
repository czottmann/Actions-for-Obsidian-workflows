# Notes for Calendar Events

This workflow will do the following:

1. Fetches a list of all events for today from a single calendar.
1. For each event in this list, a new related note will be created in Obsidian, containing key details, in a folder named "Meeting Notes".
1. The link to the Obsidian note will be appended to its related event.
1. All new notes will be appended to the current Daily Note.

Please note _(pun not intended)_: The workflow assumes thereâ€™s a current daily note.
