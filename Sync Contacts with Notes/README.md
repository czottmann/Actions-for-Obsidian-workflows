# Sync Contacts with Notes

In this demo, we’ll sync contacts from a Apple Contacts group named "Shortcuts demo" with Obsidian.

The end result will be a single note for each contact, with up-to-date contact details in the frontmatter. When the workflow is run again, it’ll find existing notes and update them, and if it finds contacts without a note, it’ll create a new one. The entries in Contacts will gain a clickable link to the Obsidian note.
